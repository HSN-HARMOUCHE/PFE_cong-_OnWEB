<h3>page 4 _ Congé/Leave : </h3>
On the leave page, employees can request time off by filling out a leave application form. The system performs date validation to prevent overlapping requests and ensures compliance with company policies. Administrators are the only ones who can review, approve, or reject leave requests. Once the administrator takes an action, an email notification is sent to the employee, keeping them informed of the status of their request.

<h3>page 5 _ Absence : </h3>
The absence page records instances when employees are absent from work without prior leave requests. It helps in maintaining accurate attendance records and identifies patterns that may need addressing.
